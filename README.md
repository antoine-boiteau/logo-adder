# logo-adder
Tiny python script for adding logos on multiple image files

For this script to work you will need :
-Python 3 and the following libraries :
    -numpy
    -PIL
    -matplotlib
  
The script will search for images placed directly in the same directory as itself and add on the bottom-right corner the image named "logo.png". 
You can pick and rename whatever png file you want as the "logo.png" file.
The script makes copy of the files it works on and writes the output files on a sub-directory called "Images_avec_logo"

The script is written in English to be comprehensive for anyone, however the outputs are written in French as this work was made for my student association localized in Normandy, France.
